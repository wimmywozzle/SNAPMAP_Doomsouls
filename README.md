## Game Overview

*In the above Screenshot, the Player is trying to stay alive.*

In Doom Souls, the player fights a Wave of enemies in an enclosed arena, and then is brought back to the main shop area to purchase equipment and level up his/her character.

This is the additional HUD you will see, on top of your usual Health/Armor/Ammo information. You can spend Souls on Weapons, Perks, and Equipment, while spending XP can increase a Skill by 10%. You SOUL LEVEL increases with each Arena Victory. When your SL increases, the game will ramp up the difficulty by spawning monsters you haven't seen yet with random modifiers.
